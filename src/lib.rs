//! Bsdiff is a method of diffing files.
//! This crate has been ported from C code.
//! The original code and more info can be found [here](https://github.com/mendsley/bsdiff).
//!
//! It is usually a good idea to use bsdiff alongside a compression algorithm like bzip2.
//!
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! use std::io::Cursor;
//! # use bsdiff::{patch, diff};
//!
//! let one = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//! let two = vec![1, 2, 4, 6];
//! let mut cursor = Cursor::new(Vec::new());
//!
//! diff::diff(&one, &two, &mut cursor).unwrap();
//! cursor.set_position(0);
//!
//! let mut patched = vec![0; two.len()];
//! patch::patch(&one, &mut cursor, &mut patched).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(patched, two);
//! ```
